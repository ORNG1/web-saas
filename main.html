        <h2>The Nothing Brand </h2>
        <p>
            Nothing is an electronics brand founded by Carl Pei in 2020 i think. He asked for the help
            of investors to build his company. Today they're doing good and released some good tech 
            products including the Phone (2) and Ear(2)
