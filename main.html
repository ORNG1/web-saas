        <p style="color: black;">
            Nothing is an electronics brand founded by Carl Pei in 2020 i think. He asked for the help<br>
            of investors to build his company. Today they're doing good and released some good tech
            products including the Phone (2) and Ear(2)
        </p>
        <hr> There is the Nothing phone (2)

        <pre>
            Now using PRE tag to see what it does.
            It should keep text as i have written it in this box

            Keeping spaces and lines between everything      ??
